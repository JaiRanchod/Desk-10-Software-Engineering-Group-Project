<!-- hi brenden, so this is the matching page, where we'd like to have a matching page card similar to the profile
card, but with a like and dislike button. When the user likes or dislikes, we need this to be sent to the 
database to be logged as a like or dislike from that user. Once the like or dislike has been made a new profile 
from the database will appear from a new profile taken from the database (might need to create some profiles
in the database for this too work). We planned to use an array to store likes and dislikes as users email addresses 
which we are planning to use as a primary key, although if it is easier mongo generates ids that can be used instead.
we are hoping that if the user doing the swiping has already liked or disliked then the candidate card will not be shown
But don't worry too much about backend, it is more front end that we need the help with

we probably need a template for the matching card which can display any profile which will be populated from the database

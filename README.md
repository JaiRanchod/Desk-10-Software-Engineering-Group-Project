<h2 align="center"> <b> Introduction </b> </h2>

<p align="center"> For our project, we established the problem of looking for housing with a suitable group of friends. Sometimes, this can occur due to people dropping out and needing another person to fill in. Other times it may be that there are people unhappy with their current living situation and looking to move to a happier and more enjoyable situation. </p>

<p align="center"> Currently the majority of university students who do not have a house sorted use Facebook pages to find a room or other people to bunch up to find a house together. We see that most people either turn to the Clifton and Stoke Bishop Facebook page or alternative housing Facebook groups designed to help people find suitable accommodation. The problems with these pages are that they can be unorganized, making it hard to track what users have seen and what users are yet to see. </p>

<p align="center"> So we have decided to create a tinder-like app for people to find like-minded housemates. It will feature a swipe action when liking or disliking user profiles, a pop-up action when a match is made and the user will be able to see their matches on a matches page.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <b> Background and Motivation </b> </h2>

<p align="center"> The identification of our problem came from personal experience, in which some team members had decided to do the Computer Science MSc later than usual, this meant most of the flats/houses had been taken and friends that were staying another year had already signed housing agreements. This left some of our team members in the position of having to find a spare room or people to live with they previously did not know. </p>

<p align="center"> So when it came to trying to find housemates... </p>

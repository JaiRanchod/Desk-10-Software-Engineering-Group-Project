<p align="center"> 

For our project, we established the problem of looking for housing with a suitable group of friends. Sometimes, this can occur due to people dropping out and needing another person to fill in. Other times it may be that there are people unhappy with their current living situation and looking to move to a happier and more enjoyable situation. Additionally, it may be that people have considered doing a postgraduate degree or are on an intercalation year, where they are unsure on where they would like to live but want to be comfortable to ensure that they enjoy their year. The project was of particular interest to us, since we were in the situation at one point or knew of someone else that were in a similar situation but could find no options to get them out. We hope that the use of this application allows these groups of people and individuals find a person/people that are well-suited to each other and leads to a happier living situation for both.

Currently the majority of university students who do not have a house sorted use Facebook pages to find a room or other people to bunch up to find a house together. We see that most people either turn to the Clifton and Stoke Bishop Facebook page or alternative housing Facebook groups designed to help people find suitable accommodation. The problems with these pages are that they can be unorganized, making it hard to track what users have seen and what users are yet to see. This is a tedious process and leads to an individual scrolling through endless housing advertisements, some of which they are illegible for as some people have specific requirements when it comes to housing. Additionally, it is hard to tell what the group dynamic is like or whether the individual would be a good fit from a simple sentence made on a Facebook post. Other alternatives that people could use are spareroom.com, however this can still lead to a mismatch in personalities and a less than ideal living situation. We also concluded that the living environment of a student is a major factor regarding an individual's mental health, especially given the pandemic and the lockdowns imposed, so it is important for a student to be living with other students with similar personalaties and interests.

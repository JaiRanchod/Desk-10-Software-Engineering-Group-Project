HouseHomies

- "Get housed with your Homies."
- "Make a space your place."
- "Putting the home in homies."
- "Bringing together a home for the homies"
- "Finding you the right homies for your home"

- HouseHomies aims to solves the age-old problem of finding you thr right homies to make a student house a home. We have found that there is nothing in the market that specifically aims to match university students together to fill a room in a university house or to join people together to form a house. We aim to provide an interactive web page that will store the users data, personality traits and the area where they want to live, and match them with other university students that want to live in the same area and have similar personalities. The user can then 'swipe' through a selection of students and decide whether they want to match with them, if so we declare a match and exchange their contact information so they can sort out housing.

<h1 align="center">Team Roles</h1>

<h2 align="center"> <b> Lucas </b> </h2>
- Frontend. Lucas has had previous experience in HTML and CSS, so Lucas’ main contribution was in styling the layout of 
the web app and helping other with issues when developing the frontend. Lucas also contributed lots to document our progress, 
survey users, and most of the wireframe.</p>

<h2 align="center"> <b> Andreas </b> </h2>
– Frontend/Backend. Andreas’ contributions include the whole of the Typeform element of our web app. Andreas had 
experience in this before and so able to use his expertise to embed this feature into our frontend and backend. Andreas also 
helped with general design of the frontend and in helping the backend.

<h2 align="center"> <b> Charles </b> </h2>
– Frontend. Charles’ main contribution was working in tandem with Lucas in developing the frontend and 
creating/developing components. Charles has also been busy in doing lots of documentation, in writing up most of the 
documentation.

<h2 align="center"> <b> Josh </b> </h2>
- Backend/Mixed. Josh’s main role was in working with Jai on the backend of the project, once they had finished that Josh 
then helped in connecting the frontend to the API so that we can pull data from our database to display in our web app. Josh 
was appointed the ‘captain’ of the team, so he also spent time in managing the team and organising meetings. Josh worked with 
Jai in pair-programming which has been very useful in progressing the project forward.

<h2 align="center"> <b> Jai </b> </h2>
- Everything. Jai’s main role was to work on the backend, but after he had finished that job, he has been crucial in 
piecing the project together. He has pretty much worked on most aspects of the project and has lent his hand to every member 
in helping them accomplish their objectives. Jai connected the frontend and backend together which wouldn’t have been possible 
without him.

<h1 align="center">Reflection on the Success of the Project</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting on the project we believe we have fulfilled the criteria of 'serious play' by solving the problem of housemate finding using a fun and interactive method of searching through profiles. We wanted to create a project that would be useful to a user rather than a project where a problem is illustrated through a playful lens but doesn't do anything pragmatic for the user.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The playful aspect of our project is the 'swiping' element of the matching page, whereby the user can either like/dislike a user and then this users card will fade off either to the left or right using some animation we coded into the front-end of our project. Whether a match has been made their profile will move the matches page, which we think is a fun element as it incorporates the dynamics of dating apps, and changes up the usually mundane scroll through housemates profiles on sites such as Spareroom.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were ambitious at the beginning of the project and we could say we may have got carried away with some ideas that, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but we reached a point with some features that we would not be able to implement given our limited technical ability. Given this, we are still very proud of the project we have built and it still serves the same purpose as intended in easing and making the search for housemates more fun, so we believe the end-product has been a success. Given more time we would have implemented more advanced features such as an option to chat with other users on the app etc. We have discussed as a group as we believe this is a viable product that could be brought to market that we will potentially work on our application post-university to add more features and make the project ready to potentially put into the real world, so we look forward in seeing where we can take it.</p>

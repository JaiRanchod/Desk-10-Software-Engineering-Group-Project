<h1 align="center">Identification of Interacting Users and Broader Stakeholders</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key aspect to consider during the proposal of this project idea was who the interacting users would be, and any broader stakeholders affected by the project idea. Initially, the platform was to be aimed at users of any demographic or city within the UK. However after several group discussions, this was decided to be too logistically challenging within the given timeframe and so the user group was narrowed down first to only Housemate finding in Bristol wards, and then further narrowed down to use by only students of the University of Bristol. These decisions have allowed the team to keep the user group relatively confined, easily identifiable and manageable. They also seemed sensible since the majority of user feedback received was from a student demographic as they were to the most accessible audience for us to accumulate feedback from, especially due to the Coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The identification of broader stakeholders affected by this project has been challenging since the interacting users have been reduced so significantly. Despite this, one could consider the effects this platform may have on other platforms providing a similar service such as 'Badi' or 'Spare Room' who may lose a market share due to the competition posed by HouseHomies. Furthermore, it is important to consider the knock-on effect on social media platforms previously used as a means of people finding house shares. These platforms may either benefit from the reduction in use for unintended purposes or suffer from the loss of usage as stakeholders potentially shift from social media platforms to HouseHomies.</p>

<h1 align="center">Discussion of Social and Ethical Implications</h1>

<p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When undertaking any software development project of this magnitude, the developers must consider its social and ethical implications. Since this project is currently confined locally to a limited group of stakeholders, it is difficult to fully assess these implications and thus we will examine this project on a more conceptual scale. All implications will be considered as if the project has been commercialised and hosted remotely rather than locally for public use as intended. The following discussion will begin to explore and evaluate these impacts consecutively.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By considering the three types of ethics, Consequentialist, Deontic and Virtue, both individually but also in tandem, this project can be adequately evaluated. Depending on a stakeholder’s point of view, this project could be largely considered ethical, since it addresses a real-life problem, and the positive consequences likely outweigh the negatives. We will start with Deontic ethics - ethics based on rules and regulations since one of the most important factors to be considered is the collection and storage of personal data on the HouseHomies platform. As developers, we must identify which data is sensitive user information, and thus which should be treated as such. This is a crucial element of any modern-day location-based social discovery platform and the stakeholders involved must be made aware of how their data is stored and distributed for third party use. To protect the information provided by users from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction the HouseHomies development team has ensured the final code and database has been well tested and will be regularly monitored for vulnerabilities. However, as with every technology platform we do not promise or expect that personal information will always remain secure, and users should be made aware of this within our privacy policy. To comply with legal requirements and assist law enforcement, users should be asked upon sign up to consent to the giving and use of any sensitive information. HouseHomies could be considered to provide a sense of privacy from stakeholders outside of the platform since their profiles are contained within the HouseHomies ecosystem, and only accessible by other users of the platform who have similarly consented to our privacy policies. They cannot be accessed from a google search or elsewhere on the internet, and this privacy is enhanced by the fact that users are only shown other profiles relevant to their matching criteria, such as location, creating smaller, confined “zones” of user groups. The development team have referred to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Code of Ethics and at all times abided by its seven ‘General Ethical Principles’:

-	Contribute to society and to human well-being, acknowledging that all people are stakeholders in computing. 
-	Avoid harm.
-	Be honest trustworthy.
-	Be fair and act not to discriminate.
-	Respect the work required to produce new ideas, inventions, creative works, and computing artifacts.
-	Respect privacy.

Finally, the platform does not knowingly breach any copyright laws, the logo was created on a free online logo making software.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consequentialist ethics considers the decision as to whether an action is ethical based on its outcomes. This is an important aspect since the HouseHomies platform is likely to have both positive and negative outcomes. One could argue that the positive outcomes outweigh the negative since user surveys and market research have both strongly indicated that the app will be filling a gap in the market and fulfilling a required purpose. Furthermore, the app will act as a tool for users to connect with other people of similar needs and interests, potentially improving their quality of life. However, social identity theory plays a part in the outcomes of this project as with it comes a high potential for in-group-out-group bias. In-group favouritism or out-group resentment could result in certain groups of people being discriminated against or isolated on the platform and in the long term could result in segregated households due to cultures, beliefs, interests etc. and in extreme cases the echo chamber effect, whereby beliefs are amplified or echoed inside a closed system. A final noteworthy negative consequence of the platforms matching system could be an over-emphasis by users on matching with other users based on their display picture. This is an unintended aim of the application since HouseHomies strives to match people based on their preferences, not their appearance. This outcome could be beneficial to some stakeholders, but generally would be considered a negative implication by most.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the Virtue ethics can be weighed up based on whether the project promotes good or bad values. This includes public health, public safety, wellbeing, honesty/ transparency, non-discrimination, equality inclusion, environmental sustainability, privacy / confidentiality and human accountability. The development team aims to</p>

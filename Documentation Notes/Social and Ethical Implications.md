<h1>Discussion of Social and Ethical Implications</h1>

<p1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When undertaking any software development project of this magnitude, the developers must consider its social and ethical implications. Since this project is currently confined locally to a limited group of stakeholders, it is difficult to fully assess these implications and thus we will examine this project on a more conceptual scale. All implications will be considered as if the project has been commercialised and hosted remotely rather than locally for public use as intended. The following discussion will begin to explore and evaluate these impacts consecutively.

<h1 align="center"> <b> Group Working Methods </b> </h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a team, our project management initially focused on splitting the responsibilities of the team in two, with Jai and Josh
focusing on the backend and the others on the frontend, focusing on getting the layout of our web app sorted, a backend schema
and API sorted. Once both teams had finished, we were then able to link these together easily. We then focused on getting data 
from the database to our frontend, this led to a combination of efforts on both teams and nearer the end of the project, 
specific roles organically dissolved into a joint team effort on getting the project finished on its final touches.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn’t have a strict timeline or specification of how exactly the project would turn out but rather let anything we come
across either organically leaves or organically add to our project. We liked this idea as it let us have free roam of being creative with the project would finally look. Instead of a strict timeline/specification we held regular meetings, and everyone would set out what they achieved the day before and what they expect to achieve by the end of the day, this helped with aligning each other objectives and allowed us as a team to be on the same page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some team members were able to meet in each other student houses to code and work together, and most of us have been working in Merchant Ventures Building regularly together. We found that being able to program and work together physically more productive and more efficient. That is not to say that we found working remotely challenging, but it was easier for each other to help debug each other’s code which led to quicker recovery times when coding. When working remotely, it worked well in that 
we were all free at the same times throughout the day, so we were able to easily organise meetings and jump on calls quickly 
if we needed an urgent issue sorting.</p>

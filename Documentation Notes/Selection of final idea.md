**Selection of final idea**

After making the selection of our final idea, we first realised that our scope was too large for the type of project we had committed to. Initial plans included several features that would be present in another fully fledged app of this type. Taking inspiration from both dating apps and housemate finder apps our initial plan included the following:

·    Main dashboard where potential housemates would appear based on a matching algorithm that included preferences given by the user as well as similarities with other users that they have previously liked.

·    Swiping for stacks of users instead of simple buttons.

·    Options to include a system for groups, where instead of having one user profile that represents the whole group, we would have had a series of users that combine to form one entity, providing links to each user when the group is shown in the stack.

·    Messaging service, intending to use the API of telegram to store and promote conversations between individuals before they exchange more private data and information.

·    Option to confirm if a house has already been found, providing further details on profile.

·    Video option for a better introduction to individuals.

When considering what should be included in our project, we instead chose to focus on a core set of features that can easily be expanded on for future work. Creating a well-executed and basic design that acts as a solid foundation. The key features included are as seen on our final wireframe design and are listed as follows:

·    Stack of user profiles on home page that have an option for a like and a dislike. These profiles include simple information that will be key for deciding on a housemate such as a person’s gender, age, budget etc.

·    Page to adjust the users own information which is initially presented at signup and can be used if there are any changes that need to be adjusted for.

·    Each profile represents a single entity, detailing their info as well as the option of up to 4 pictures. Including whether they are a group or individual. Any data included on this profile can be used to filter, preventing a build up of unwanted housemates on a user’s stack.

·    Matches page that allows users to send a phone number or email address to users they have matched with in order to start communications.

·    Instead of searching users withing a location range, we are instead focusing only on University of Bristol students and as such providing options of neighbourhoods where users are prioritised in the stack based on the desired neighbourhoods

Personality quiz which we will use in the aims of matching users together

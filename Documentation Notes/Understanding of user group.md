<h2 align="center">Analysis of Survey Feedback</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short survey was created and distributed to various potential users as a means to understand more about their current opinion on the concept of a House share finding platform as well as gain some feedback on what they considered to be important factors when finding a housemate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, a total of 18 users completed this short questionnaire regarding our web application idea. The results mostly conclude that the platform would be used by members of society and help to solve a real-world issue.</p>

- When asked which platform people would currently use if in need of finding housemates, 100% of users selected social media. This strongly indicates that there is currently a gap in the market for a functional or popular house share finding application.
- One user selected both Social Media and Website/Application, suggesting they would be inclined to use both platforms. Our aim is to make our platform more engaging and easier to use than house share pages on social media.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design process began shortly after the proroject proposal had been confirmed. Several members of the team had drafted on paper their design and layout ideas, but due to remotely working on Microsoft Teams and Discord, it was initially difficult for individual tema members to bring their ideas together into one dinifinitive paper prototype. To solve this problem the team decided in late Feburary to use a collaborative interface design tool such as Figma. This made the design process much smoother and allowed the team to all be on the same page since we were able to meet for a video call and all work on the same Figma sketch simultaneously.</p>

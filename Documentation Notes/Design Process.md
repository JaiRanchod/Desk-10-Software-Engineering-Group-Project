<h1 align="center">Design Process</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design process began shortly after the proroject proposal had been confirmed. Several members of the team had drafted on paper their design and layout ideas, but due to remotely working on Microsoft Teams and Discord, it was initially difficult for individual tema members to bring their ideas together into one dinifinitive paper prototype. To solve this problem the team decided in late Feburary to use a collaborative interface design tool such as Figma. This made the design process much smoother and allowed the team to all be on the same page since we were able to meet for a video call and all work on the same Figma sketch simultaneously, combining our paper prottype ideas to create one singlar wireframe prototype.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The original wireframe prototype has significant differences in design from the final product. This is mainly due to our decision to base the final design off of an Angular template, but also a result of the front end team discovering which elements of the design could realisticaly be implemented in the real life code. Despite these design changes, the functionality of the application has for the most part remained consistent since the start of the project and an updated wireframe was later created as a reference for front end code development and a means to aquire user feedback information.</p>

### Clear Definition of our Problem

**Our problem is as follows:**

Searching for a spare room accomodation is a significant commitment. Whilst there are websites out there that provide spare room search engines which help students and young professionals find a place to stay, they forget one of the most important aspects of renting out a room... getting along with housemates.

While young professionals may not include "getting along with housemates" as a priority, we believe university students certainly do.

By exploring and ideating gaps in the spare room market, we were, thus, able to narrow down **our problem** to include that spare room search websites:

1. Primarily focus on finding a room, whilst ignoring the compatability of housemates
2. Are dull and unengaging
3. Don't specifically cater for the student market

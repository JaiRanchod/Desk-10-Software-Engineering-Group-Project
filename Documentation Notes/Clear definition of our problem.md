<h1 align="center">Clear Definition of Our Problem</h1>

<h2 align="center">Our Problem is as Follows</h2> 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Searching for a spare room accomodation is a significant commitment. Whilst there are websites out there that provide spare room search engines which help students and young professionals find a place to stay, they forget one of the most important aspects of renting out a room... getting along with housemates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While young professionals may not include "getting along with housemates" as a priority, we believe university students certainly do.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By exploring and ideating gaps in the spare room market, we were, thus, able to narrow down **our problem** to include that spare room search websites:</p>

<p>1. Primarily focus on finding a room, whilst ignoring the compatability of housemates.
2. Are dull and unengaging.
3. Don't specifically cater for the student market.</p>

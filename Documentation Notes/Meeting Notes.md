**Meeting Notes** – We mainly used Microsoft Teams for our meetings and then typed up a summary of our meeting on discord, so everyone had easy access to what tasks needed and completing and when ideally, they could be done for.

Watch the data model video and begin to understand what we would need to complete a data model for our own project.

We want to convert our paper prototype into a wireframe so we can begin testing as soon as possible. To achieve this, we want to use Figma. 

Try to begin some initial testing using the paper prototype to try and receive some feedback that could be put into the wireframe. 

We are also aiming to complete lab worksheets up to week 7 by the beginning of Easter break.

After doing some research, we found a template that we thought would look good for our website. We thought even though this would look different to the wireframe, due to time constraints using a template for the front-end might be a good idea. Need to get permission? 

Adjust wireframe – We all evaluated what we though worked and what did not work with everyone else’s design and tried to improve the wireframe quickly. 

All of us, want to make our own data model and this means that we can try to combine all our perspectives and gaining a more complete data model by the end.

Thought we would have some difficulty implementing the conversation functionality between users, so as an alternative we would automatically provide contact information if there was a match. But we understood that there were potential concerns with this, for example if someone accidentally matched, so we would ensure that users had the option to send over contact information. We have decided to keep the thought in the back of our minds that we would like to use the Telegram API to try and embed the conversation feature within our app. 

How are we going to do matching? We want to filter by preferences to ensure that users are matched with other users they have some things in common with. 

Complete the survey so we can gain additional feedback for our wireframe and initial concept.

We have decided that we would struggle to complete our app within the given timeframe, and we would need to adjust certain features. We have decided that we would have the app for University of Bristol students rather than just general people, but we still think this could be expanded quite easily and has big potential. 

Store the user profile and preferences separately so we can try and get matching by combining these and getting a gauge on how likely they were to match. 

We also set up our own tasks to ensure that we were covering all bases of the documentation and then could look at these all with the group and try to improve them if needed. 

Charles – Documentation for wireframe. 

Jai – Data model and documentation surrounding this.

Andreas – Summarising all our initial ideas.

Josh – Documenting on the selection of the final idea. 

Lucas – Getting meeting agendas sorted.

After discussing how we were going to match users, we decided that it would be quite difficult to do it through the preferences they have inputted, so the alternative we have come up with is that we would embed a personality quiz within our application and then create a score based on this. We would then look at the scores of 2 users and see if they are a good fit. We understand there are problems with this method, but we have thought of several ways of attempting to do this, so we will analyse them in the coming weeks. 

We found out that we could also develop this for a mobile application rather than a web application and we do think that the project might be more suited to a mobile application, however this would now take a lot of time to change so we have decided to stick with the web page. If there is time, we would like to explore the possibility of also providing a mobile application, however none of us are sure the complexity surrounding this now. 

Try and finalise all documentation so we are up to date.

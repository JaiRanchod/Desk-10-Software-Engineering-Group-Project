<h1 align="center"> <b> Scope of Project </b> </h1>



<h2 align="center"> <b> Conceptual Scope </b> </h2>

 

- <b>How ‘big’ is your project? What’s the balance between serious and playful sides?</b>

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feedback from demonstrators and group reflection has made us come to realise that our initial project scope was fairly ambitious. We have managed our expectations with reality and scaled the size of the project down to a more manageable level. The project is on the more serious side as we are attempting to fill a gap in the market and promote a happier living environment. Fun aspects however include a personality quiz and swiping animations.<p>

 

- Are you looking to raise awareness about your serious issue or to provoke changes in attitude/behaviour? If so, is this with a particular demographic/group?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not necessarily to raise awareness but we are hoping this platform will provide a useful tool for people in need of a house share. Our current demographic is aimed at University of Bristol students to keep the scope of the project small and manageable, but this may change in the future.</p>

 
- What are the primary objectives for your project? Are there any you could prioritize?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our primary objectives are to create an easier method to find like-minded housemates. One of the key priorities of this is an interface that is easy to use, visually appealing and works well.</p> 

 

·    Remember that the aim is to build a minimum value viable product (MVP), with the intended aim that it would be at the level to show investors.

 
<h2 align="center"> <b> Technical Scope </b> </h2>

 

1)   Which sections are you focussing on? Agree as a team is there is there a focus on the backend/ frontend?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project will require both front and back-end expertise. We need the app to be aesthetically pleasing and easy to use, but we will also be dealing with a lot of data.</p>

 

2)   Does the technical development support the concept? Can you trim out anything that doesn’t?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, the technical side of our app will hopefully allow us to match like-minded individuals. We have trimmed out a lot of extra questions and preferences we were initially asking for. Instead, we have opted for a personality quiz as it is more playful and will be easier to implement (hopefully).</p>

 

3)   Decide on the fidelity of each of your functions. For instance, do you need to integrate a fully working map? Or would a static one do as a proof of concept?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could have a static map in the minimum viable product, but we would like to have a fully dynamic working one if possible.</p>

 

 

 

 

4)   Data. Is this ‘live’ or running from a hand-selected data set?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data will be a combination of live and hand-selected data. We hope to populate the database with some example user profiles, so that when our project is hosted locally for marking, markers can create their own profile and hopefully be matched up to some of our test profiles.</p> 

 

5) Use user stories to identify technical scope?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking to users that have been stuck in houses that weren’t their first choice, it was clear to see that they would be happier in a house with more like-minded individuals. Users have also given us some opinions on what they find to be important when deciding how to select their flatmates. We have constructed a questionnaire to try and find out these preferences.</p>

 

<h2 align="center"> <b> Evaluation Scope </b> </h2>

 

1)   What evaluation questions do you have? What do you know already? What do you not know? Do you have any assumptions?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assumption: That everyone that uses our app will be from the University of Bristol. In the future we would look to improve the verification process to ensure that only those from Bristol can use it.</p>

 

2)   When are you evaluating it?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are evaluating when we are just about to hit a milestone. So, at the end of the design stage, we continuously tried to improve the prototypes until we were all happy with the design.</p>

 

3)   What evaluation methods are you using?

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evaluation methods – We have used a combination of both questionnaires interviews and group discussions. We think this is a good approach in the current pandemic.</p>

 

4)   What is the depth of your data collection and analysis? 

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data collection – We hope to gain as many users as possible through questionnaires and we hope to gain more insightful information through the interviews. This means we can ask more in-depth questions.</p>

 

5)   It’s ok to tell us how you would evaluate given further time and resources (we don’t expect you for instance to run a 30-person user study!)

 

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had more time a group study might have been fun and informative, but this was difficult to do.</p>

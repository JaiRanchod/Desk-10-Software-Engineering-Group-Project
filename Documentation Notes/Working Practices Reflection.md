<h1 align="center">Reflection on Working Practices</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were lucky with our group in that we had all known each other beforehand through either working together in other modules and also through working together in the Merchant Ventures Building, so from the outset we knew we would well together in a team. What stood out from the start is that we all had big ambitions in creating a project that would test our technical abilities and be a challenging yet fun project to take on. We understood as a small 
team this would be a challenge but our determinations aligned and so we were able to take this challenge on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The impact of COVID-19 on our project is later discussed in the 'Coronavirus Discussion', so we won't go into detail but to provide a brief overview. The main factor it affected was the effectiveness of our meetings, as after lockdown restrictions were lifted we began to work in MVB together and we were a lot more productive in furthering the project. It was easier to converse with other members of the team, as with online meetings there can only be one 
person talking at a time, so we liked being able to talk to other team members more easily.</p>

- Before undertaking this project we had all known each other through other modules and some of had worked together in MVB, so we already knew that we would work well together as a team.
- We worked well in that we were all ambitious in how big we wanted to take the project, so were all on the same wavelength in all had big ambitions with the project, which was a blessing and maybe a hinderance
- We were able to communiate if we didnt thinbk aother idea was good
- We all took responsibilites and we all worked at a smilar pace and there were no slackers
- Half had mac half had wiondows

We have already discussed the impact of COVID-19 on our project and how this affected how we worked together, so we won't go into detail but to provide a brief overview.

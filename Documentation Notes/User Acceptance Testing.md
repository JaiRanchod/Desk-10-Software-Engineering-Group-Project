<h1 align="center">User Acceptance Testing</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To generate user testing, we sampled a group of University of Bristol students from a variety of years, including freshers who could arguably benefit the most from our app after restrictions imposed when meeting new people, limiting their options for future housemates. The database was initially loaded with several sample users which our testers could choose to use or they were allowed to generate their own user through our registration page within the app. Here there was some input required from our end as the new profiles would currently not have any likes as the other users were not active. To resolve this we simply logged into some of the sample users and manually liked the newly created user profile, this could have also been done by adding the user id to the array of liked users in the database but it was more convenient on our end to simply log in as the different sample users. From here the users were given freedom to play around with the app as they liked, including changing any of the user profile settings and swiping on profiles that would appear from the homepage of the logged in account, noting any things they liked or disliked as well as any other feedback. All of our testers decided to create their own profiles rather than using one of the sample users, with their feedback as follows:</p>

<h3 align="center">User 1:</h3>

<h4>Positives:</h4>

- Looks good and simplicity makes it easy to use.

<h4>Negatives:</h4>

- Can't see all of the users information on the matched card.

<h4>General feedback:</h4>

- Overall it looks good and easy to use, would definitely use the app.

<h3 align="center">User 2:</h3>

<h4>Positives:</h4>

- I like the aesthetics, as well as logo and name, the overall design is really good.

<h4>Negatives:</h4>

- Would like to be able to see budget on the matches page after matching with someone.

<h4>General feedback:</h4>
N/A

<h3 align="center">User 3:</h3>

<h4>Positives:</h4>

- The personality score is cool and something nice to take into account when living with other people. Especially with current circumstances meaning more time is being spent at home with your flatmates.

<h4>Negatives:</h4>

- None, works well and has fun features.

General feedback:</p>

<h3 align="center">User4:</h3>
<h4>Positives:</h4>

- Functional and straight to the point. Very easy to set up with the registration survey and then can get straight into matching.

<h4>Negatives:</h4>

- For those in a group looking to get an extra housemate to fill a vacancy there can only be one image and name. It might be nice to have more images available for the rest of the group. There is also no option to change the image or delete account which would be good once housemates have been found

<h3 align="center>User5:</h3>
	   
<h4>Positives:</h4>
- Good layout and design, easy to navigate and edit profile to desired changes.

<h4>Negatives:</h4>

- Some of the users info is fixed with certain options in the registration but is allowed to be changed to anything on the edit profile screen, it would be nice to have them consistent across both parts.

<h4>General feedback:</h4>

- Overall I think it is really good and has great potential, just a few little things that would be nice to have included.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After users had completed their trial of the app we reverted any changes they had made, including deleting any new accounts and changing fields back to their initial state for sample users. This was done in order to preserve anonymity and protect privacy as our passwords are not currently being hashed for this version of our web app. The users feedback also remains anonymous to again protect privacy of users.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On evaluating user acceptance testing, it is clear that our use of template proved to be a good decision as almost all of our users commented on the appearance as a positive. The layout was also commonly praised, here it is clear that sticking to the well-known template of current dating apps such as Tinder, Hinge and Bumble proved effective as users recognised the familiar layout. Considering the negative feedback, many of these include comments about usability, including having all information available for current matches and more accessibility for groups. This are definitely features that should be considered in the future and with more time we would have been likely to implement.</p>

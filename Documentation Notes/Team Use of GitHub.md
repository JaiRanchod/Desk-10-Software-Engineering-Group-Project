<h1 align="center"> <b> Team Use of GitHub </b> </h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main branch that we used for our project was the develop branch this is where we would upload our latest versions of our project to. Everyone also had their branch which they would push their latest versions to so that we were able to merge onto develop without risking overwriting the working version. We found this method of continous integration worked for us and our use of git improved as we progressed through the project. However sometimes we found that with people working on completely different sections it made sense to pull anotherâ€™s branch and then 
copy over the parts of the project that that individual had been working on, this avoided the need to merge through GitHub, 
which we had encountered problems with before with working on different operating systems. We also liked this method of working 
as it left the working version on the branch they had pulled from, and we could work on integrating our work onto that version 
locally and then we would push this version onto our branch. So in this respect we didn't continually integrate every change that was made but we found the method we used work for us as a team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to merging large overlaps of work we found we ran into many technical issues which took a long time to fix, amd this served as a pivotal point in the adoption of a more regular use of git, so that any code/work added would not have been too large to cause any issues that we experienced before. We also had now to at the end of the day if someone had pushed to their branch to see what changes they had made and so other members of the team could be updated with what stage the project was now at, and if we two members needed to combine their work, this daily communication made that process easier.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hindsight, we agreed we could have better organised our use of GitHub in that we would have an organised way of pushing and pulling as at the start, different members were at different stages in their familarity of Git. However, even so we believe that the way that we had used Git may not have been the most efficient way but it was effective in that we were able to communicate our changes and the team were regularly pushing new versions of the project to the repository. We found that once we were able to work together physically in the university buildings it was easier to communicate what changes we had done, and now that we could communicate instantly (as we were in the same room) we were able to solve any technical issues that we had with GitHub</p>

<h1 align="center"> <b> Team Use of GitHub </b> </h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main branch that we used for our project was the develop branch this is where we would upload our latest versions of our project to. Everyone also had their branch which they would push their latest versions to so that we were able to merge onto develop without risking overwriting the working version.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We found in most cases with people working on completely different sections it made sense to pull anotherâ€™s branch and then 
copy over the parts of the project that that individual had been working on, this avoided the need to merge through GitHub, 
which we had encountered problems with before with working on different operating systems. We also liked this method of working 
as it left the working version on the branch they had pulled from, and we could work on integrating our work onto that version 
locally and then we would push this version onto our branch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would communicate at the end of the day if someone had pushed to their branch to see what changes they had made and then others could add to that version. We found that as most of us were working physically together it was easier to work 
in merging our work physically.</p>

<h2 align="center">Problem statement</h2>

One of the key reasons why we decided to pursue HouseHomies was to overcome the **dullness** and **unengaging** nature of our competitors. 

<h2 align="center">Here are some examples of our competitors' designs:</h2>

Defining the problem we wanted to solve clearly illustrated that UX design needed to be a priority. After all, to achieve an engaging, interactive and fun web app for finding spare rooms requires a modern design and an easy to use user interface.It is for this reason that all decisions regarding design were made on the basis of how engaging and interactive they would be to the user.

## Here are the key point that illustrate our UX approach

### We used a template

We knew that with the available time limit & experience throughout the team it was unrealistic to expect a fully working web application, let alone an engaging one. Choosing to utilise the power of a pre made template with modern component designs gave us the tools, and the opportunity, to design a web application in the way we envisioned it.

### We adopted an already succesful interaction model... Tinder's swipe

It is known that Tinder's swipe & match methodology has proved to be a huge success. Not only it is a fun and interactive way of liking or disliking a listing, it is also a very efficient process in finding mutual compatability between two users. One of the gaps that we spotted in the market, was that spare room search engines tend to focus primarily on the room itself, ignoring an important element of house sharing; the roommates. By adopting a similar approach to Tinder and introducing it in our web app, we were able to directly address this issue. We combined pre made components from the template we employed and created dynamic interactive cards to simulate the swiping nature of Tinder. This approach allowed us to sucesfully deploy our desired user experience in a short time frame.

### We implemented an engaging onboarding process

As the registration process is one of the first interactions a user has with our web app, we wanted to ensure the experience would stand out from our competitors. Once again, we leveraged the flexibility of a third party tool called Typeform, which allowed us to build a smooth and engaging onboarding experience.



### We used the minimum required number of pages

When designing the user experience, we mutually agreed that it should be as simple as possible. By habing a straightforward navigation bar at the top of the page showing the listings, the matches and options to edit your profile, we ensured that every user would be able to use the web app without any difficulty. A common theme among competitors was the high level of complexity and features offered to the user. We have found that this complexity is one of the aspects that contributes to a web app feeling dull and unengaging. By keeping it simple, we were able to directly solve the problem we have defined and delievered a web app that does a simple function, but does it well!

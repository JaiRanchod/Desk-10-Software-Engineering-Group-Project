Defining the problem we wanted to solve clearly illustrated that UX design needed to be a priority. After all, to achieve an engaging, interactive and fun web app for finding spare rooms requires a modern design and an easy to use user interface.It is for this reason that all decisions regarding design were made on the basis of how engaging and interactive they would be to the user.

## Here are the key point that illustrate our UX approach

### We used a template

We knew that with the available time limit & experience throughout the team it was unrealistic to expect a fully working web application, let alone an engaging one. Choosing to utilise the power of a pre made template with modern component designs gave us the tools, and the opportunity, to design a web application in the way we envisioned it.

1. **Your solution:** Run through your approach to solving the problem. Give your readers a taste of what to expect at the end of your storyâ€”what deliverables or final output will you produce?
2. **Your role:** Let your readers know how you have contributed to the project. Your role in the project should be linked to the job you apply for. For example, if you apply for a UX researcher job, then ideally you should have played a [UX research](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-research) role in your case study project.

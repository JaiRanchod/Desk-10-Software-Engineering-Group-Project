<h1 align="center">Future Work</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are many features that we wanted to add to the project, but a lot of them were too difficult to implement given our limited technical ability and time availability</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had more time, we would have liked to implement more features such as:
  
* Chat feature - where users could message each other on the app. At the moment, our application shows a user's contact number once a match has been made but people may be more comfortable in using a chat feature as people may not want to give away their contact number on the first instance of matching with someone. This would increase the privacy of users, leading to a safer experience using the application.
  
* Matching algorithm - where the profiles most similar to the users would appear first, this was part of our original idea but upon working on the code for the project it was clear this was too great a task to implement in the timeframe we had, instead, we opted for to just have the profiles show in random order. This doesn't affect the functionality or effectiveness of our application as we only have a limited amount of users in the database so it is quick and easy to search through all the profiles, however, if that application did gain momentum in the number of users using the app we would implement a matching algorithm to show users that are suitable to the user ie. in the same city, similar interests and a similar budget because it would be tedious in searching through all the profiles.</p>
  
* Email confirmation - the users would need to confirm that they are real people using a real email, this will improve the safety of users.
  
* Video feature - we would have like to implement an optional video element whereby the users could record themselves to portray their personality or the user could record a video of the house they are looking for a housemate to fill a room in, this will improve the safety of users as it will be hard to 'catfish' users and so this will reduce the number of users trying to impersonate someone they are not. It will also be useful in showing users the room they will fill as sometimes photographs of the room do not do a room justice.

* Forgot password - we have left the forgotten password button on the log in page but it currently does not work. So if we had more time we would implement this so that a user would be able to reset their password. We couldn't implement this function at the moment as we would have to send a reset password email and we don't have a server to send out these emails.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking forward to where this could go and we have discussed as a team its potential to be put to market. So we are going to keep working on the project either over the summer or after we have finished our dissertations. Now that we will have more time we can spend more time learning to implement features to improve the functionality of the application to make it more 'market ready'.</p>

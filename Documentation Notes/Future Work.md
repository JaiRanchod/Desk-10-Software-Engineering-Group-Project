<h2>Future Work</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are many features that we wanted to add to the project, but a lot of the features were too difficult to implement given our limited technical ability and the limited time in creating the project.</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature would be to implement a matching algorithm, where the profiles most similar to the users would appear first, this was part of our original idea but upon working on the code for the project it was clear this was too great a task to implement in the timeframe we had, instead we opted for to 
just have the profiles show in a random order. This doesn't affect the functionality or effectiveness of our application as we only have a limited amount 
of users in the database so its quick and easy to search through all the profiles, however if that application did gain momentum in the amount of users 
using the app we would implement a matching algorithm to show users that are suitable to the user ie. in the same city, similar interests and a similar 
budget.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had more time, we would have liked to implement a chat feature, where users could message each other on the app. At the moment, our application shows a user's contact number once a match has been made but people may be more comfortable in using a chat feature as people may not won't to give away 
their contact number on the first instance of matching with someone. This would increase the privacy of users, leading to a safer experience using the 
application.</p>

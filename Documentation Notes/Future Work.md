<h1 align="center">Future Work</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are many features that we wanted to add to the project, but a lot of the features were too difficult to implement given our limited technical ability and the limited time in creating the project.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One feature would be to implement a matching algorithm, </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had more time, we would have liked to implement a chat feature, where users could message each other on the app. At the moment, our application shows a user's contact number once a match has been made but people may be more comfortable in using a chat feature as people may not won't to give away their contact number on the first instance of matching with someone. This would increase the privacy of users, leading to a safer experience using the application.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we had more time, we would have liked to implement more features such as:
  
* Chat feature - where users could message each other on the app. At the moment, our application shows a user's contact number once a match has been made but people may be more comfortable in using a chat feature as people may not won't to give away their contact number on the first instance of matching with someone. This would increase the privacy of users, leading to a safer experience using the application.
  
* Matching algorithm - where the profiles most similar to the users would appear first, this was part of our original idea but upon working on the code for the project it was clear this was too great a task to implement in the timeframe we had, instead we opted for to just have the profiles show in a random order. This doesn't affect the functionality or effectiveness of our application as we only have a limited amount of users in the database so its quick and easy to search through all the profiles, however if that application did gain momentum in the amount of users using the app we would implement a matching algorithm to show users that are suitable to the user ie. in the same city, similar interests and a similar budget.</p>
  
* Email confirmation - the users would need to confirm that they are real people using a real email, this will improve the safety of users.
  
* Video feature - we would have like to implement an optional video element whereby the users could record themsalves to portray their personality or the user could record a video of the house they are looking for a housemate to fill a room in, this will imrpove the saefty of users as it will be hard to 'catfish' users and so this will reduce the amount of users trying to imperosnate someone they are not.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are looking forward to where this could go and we have discussed as a team its potential to be put to market. So we are going to keep working on the project either over summer or after we have finished our dissertations. Now that we will have more time we can spend more time learning to implement features to improve the functionality of the application to make it more 'market ready'.</p>

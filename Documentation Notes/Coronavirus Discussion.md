One of the major factors that effected our project work was that we were not able to meet in person to have team meetings and programming sessions. While 
we did have successful meetings via Microsoft Teams, we found that we were more efficient in communicationg and working together when we were able to 
legally meet in the Merchant Ventures Building.

<h1 align="center"> <b> Coronavirus Discussion </b> </h1>

<p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coronavirus has in no doubt affected how we have approached this academic year, and this project is no exception. As a group we have found online teaching challenging and we have all had to adapt in how we learn and work, but in that we have learnt a lot of valuable skills that we 
would not have necessarily acquired.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first piece of work this year in which we had to work as group on a collective piece of work, so in respect to how we have previously worked in other modules this was a different dynamic when working online. We learnt valuable skills in team management, online communication skills, 
organisational skills etc. We found that we could hold meetings that were both effective and efficient, although after the lockdown measures lifted we 
have found ourselves working in the Merchant Ventures Building where we would hold our meetings and work together. We found working together physcially 
more productive than working online as we were able to help each other more effectively. Although we did value the skills we learnt working on the 
project online we were happy to be able to work together in a physical setting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We found outside of academic work that this year had been more stressful than our other academic years due to the pandemic as we missed the social aspect of the university experience which we believe is a crucial apsect in a students wellbeing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect on the online learning experience that we liked was that at almost all times there was always either a lecturer or teaching assistant available 'after hours' to do a video call or answer our questions, which we would not have utilised as much if we were being taught in person. So we 
really appreciated this apsect of the online learning experience </p>

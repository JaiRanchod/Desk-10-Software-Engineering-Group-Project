## Background Literature

### ***Supporting our idea with data***

Firstly, it is worth mentioning that finding data to support our idea was a difficult task. Seeing as our area of research is not popular and our idea itself is niche, we couldn't find research that directly relates and supports our assumptions. Thus, our primary source of validation was derived from the student surveys we carried out. However, we did find indirect data that positively support the need and feasability of our idea. 

One of our sources that positively supports our idea is the **National Student Accomodation Survey**. In 2019, it was indicated that "just over half of all students (**54%**) rent rooms or houses from private landlords and estate agents." This figure, demonstrates the enormous demand for student accomodation and therefore suggests that demands for spare rooms are also likely to remain high. Some of the problems our app aims to solve and, thus, positives it brings is:

- That students can find more affordable accomodation
- That students can be find accomodation last minute

Whilst renting a spare room vs renting a studio or a flat already saves the student a considerable amount, the 2021 National Student Survey suggests that the benefits outlined above are more attractive than ever. The report outlines that the unpredictability and uncertainty covid has brought, means that students are less motivated to pursue long term commitments when it comes to student accomodation. After all, this past academic year has seen that a "**third of students** in the survey had moved back home to live with their parents or guardians." 

On the basis of this information we can assume that demand for spare rooms will remain intact and most likely continue to rise as its flexibility and affordability compliment the needs of students in post pandemic era.

### ***Learning to build a web app with Angular***

The first resrouce we used for learning the basics of setting up a web app were the worksheet material provided by the course. While the material helped us gain a basic understanding of how each element of the mean stack works, we often needed to search for further resources to enhance our learning, but to also find specific use cases that matched our project needs.

For us, what seemed to work well and efficient was utilising the plethora of resources on YouTube. Here are some of the key resources that helped us achieve this project. As a team, we decided that we would watch and interact specific videos that provide a solid foundation regarding various aspects of the development process. While the below resources were mandatory by the whole team, there were numerous other resources sought out by each individual.

#### **Angular basics**

- Angular Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Angular & TypeScript - This 2 hour video course was split into various sections, giving brief introductions with real time demonstrations making it easy to understand. Before starting to code, we set a task within the team to watch this introductory video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5E2AVpwsko&t=620s

#### **JWT Authentication & User logins**

- JWT Authorization | Angular Router Guards | Token Refresh - We used this walkthrough video to uderstand how JWT authentication can be used to login in users and carry it throughout the whole web app.

- Alongside the above video, we looked into a course from Angular-University.io which provides a full guide in using web tokens for logging in users. (https://blog.angular-university.io/angular-jwt-authentication/)

#### **MongoDB & Express**

- Angular - Node - MongoDB & Express (MEAN) Tutorial for Beginners - Getting Started - Once again, we set this video as a team task so that we could gain a good understanding of how to incorporate MongoDB & Express in our application. This resouce was particularly useful in showing how to get user input and send it to mongoDB. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tRLveSyNz8)

Reflecting on our background literature approach, we believe that it was appropriate and helpful to our project. With brief primary and secondary research, we were able to gather evidence that suggests there is demand for the problem we are solving and by setting mandatory resources to study as a team, we ensured that every team member was able to contribute in all aspects of the developmeent process, leading to efficiency and a feeling of inclusivity by all.

***Supporting our idea with data***

Firstly, it is worth mentioning that finding data to support our idea was a difficult task. Seeing as our area of research is not popular and our idea itself is niche, we couldn't find research that directly relates and supports our assumptions. Thus, our primary source of validation was derived from the student surveys we carried out. However, we did find indirect data that positively support the need and feasability of our idea. 

One of our sources that positively supports our idea is the **National Student Accomodation Survey**. In 2019, it was indicated that "just over half of all students (**54%**) rent rooms or houses from private landlords and estate agents." This figure, demonstrates the enormous demand for student accomodation and therefore suggests that demands for spare rooms are also likely to remain high. Some of the problems our app aims to solve and, thus, positives it brings is:

- That students can find more affordable accomodation
- That students can be find accomodation last minute

Whilst renting a spare room vs renting a studio or a flat already saves the student a considerable amount, the 2021 National Student Survey suggests that the benefits outlined above are more attractive than ever. The report outlines that the unpredictability and uncertainty covid has brought, means that students are less motivated to pursue long term commitments when it comes to student accomodation. After all, this past academic year has seen that a "**third of students** in the survey had moved back home to live with their parents or guardians." 

On the basis of this information we can assume that demand for spare rooms will remain intact and most likely continue to rise as its flexibility and affordability compliment the needs of students in post pandemic era.

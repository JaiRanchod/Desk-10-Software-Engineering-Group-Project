**Initial Ideas**

 

Our first ideation process consisted of using a Matrix which consisted of specific and rather playful themes to trigger creative solutions.

 Out of all the themes and their playful variations, as a group, we showed a particular interest in the following areas:

·    Tinder for finding housemates – matching groups to individuals 

·    Finding movie to watch using virtual dartboard (movie recommender based on preferences) 

·    Find someone to eat dinner with online – sort of like tinder, one meal at a time 

·    Trip advisor but for care homes

 

Our initial methodology of narrowing down to our potential project was to judge the ideas on the basis of individual interest and excitement towards them. There was a clear consensus that **A)** The tinder for finding housemates idea and **B)** The Finding a movie to watch using a virtual dartboard; were the two favourites.

 

Narrowing down to 2 potential projects, we now considered a different approach to choosing our project; one that relies on expected complexity, feasibility and how big of a problem it solves. Ultimately, after exploring the logistics and requirements of building some kind of graphical interface that would mimic a dartboard, we mutually agreed that it was simply too hard to achieve. We then looked into identifying the complexities and feasibility of making a tinder for housemates’ web app and our research gave us confidence that this is the project we will pursue.

 

The most important factors that give us confidence in this project is the fact that it solves a real problem, it involves a good balance between backend and frontend requirements, and we all agree that it will be a huge learning experience for us all.

<h3 align="center"> <b> Clifton Stoke Bishop Tickets </b> </h3>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the majority of University of Bristol students use the 'Clifton Stoke Bishop Tickets' Facebook page to post/look for spare rooms or other students to live with. This could be considered an effective way of finding potential housemates as the majority of students follow/like 
that page, however, that page is not primarily for student accomodation. It is used primarily for selling event tickets, lost and found items and also 
businesses advertising. This means its a tedious process in finding housing posts and some of which they are illegible for as some people have specific 
requirements when it comes to housing. Also with these facebook advertisements, it is one party that explicitly reaches out to the party who posted the 
advertisement. This sort of communication method may discouraged people from recahing out to others in fear of rejection in case the other party does not 
want to partner up with them. Our application solves this problem as you can only communicate with the other party if both parties has 'liked' the other 
user so it doesn't allow a user to be explicitely rejected.</p>
  
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our application aims to make the process of finding housemates as streamlined as possible, and avoid all the inefficiencies that occur infinding housemate through Facebook.</p>

<h3 align="center"> <b> Spareroom </b> </h3>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spareroom is the other major provider in finding housemates or a spare room. Spareroom caters for both students and the general public, and it includes many factors which help in finding suitable housemates/spare room, such as smoking household, occupation and living with landlord etc. 
One of the aspects of Spareroom that we liked is that your were able to set a profile picture, a bio and you can also list a set of options of what 
you're looking for which improves on the Facebook posts which usually only detail the room and price, and not anything to do with anything of the people 
they'll live with.</p>

<h3 align="center"> <b> Badi </b> </h3>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Badi is another application that facilitates finding housemates or a spare room. The aesthetics of the badi site was very appealing and we found that they offered many options in finding specific rooms/people that suit your personal taste such as:</p>

- <p>Each property that is listed by the user has details on availability, current flatmates, preferred flatmates details, size, include amenitiesand amap 
at the bottom, also links to similar rooms</p>
- <p>Preferred flatmate option that includes gender, age, occupation</p>
- Pictures of the flats with a user who has a score that is based on things like verified data, including bank and personal details

<p>Badi was similar to spareoom, but both failed to make the process of finding a housemate fun, which we will aim to deliver in our project.

<h3 align="center"> <b> Tinder </b> </h3>

<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all the applications we have looked through none of them provide any playful aspect in finding housemates or a spare room. So we looked to Tinder to see if we could take any ideas from Tinder to see if we can make housemate finding a more fun experience. Having looked at Tinder we 
found it easy to navigate with minimal tabs making it user friendly, easy to get started and we found the swipe aspect more fun than just scrolling 
through endless amounts of profiles. We found that because you have to swipe through every profile as well, there is no chance of scrolling/swiping past 
any suitable housemates that you might have missed.

<h1 align="center">Reflection on the Success of the Project</h1>

Reflecting on the project we believe we have fulfilled the criteria of 'serious play' by solving the problem of housemate finding using a fun and interactive method of searching through profiles. We wanted to create a project that would be useful to a user rather than a project where a problem is illustrated through a playful lens but doesn't actually do anything pragmatic for the user.

The playful aspect of our project is the 'swiping' element of the matching page, whereby user can either like/dislike a user and then this users card will fade off either to the left or right using some animation we coded into the front-end of our project. Whether a match has been made their profile will move the the matches page, which we think is a fun element as it incorporates the dynamics of dating apps, and changes up the usually mundane scroll through housemates profiles on sites such as Spareroom.

We were ambitious at the beginning of the project and we could say we may have got carried away with some ideas that we did not realise would be outside our technical abilities.

playful aspect - tinder swipe, animation, get to see your matches

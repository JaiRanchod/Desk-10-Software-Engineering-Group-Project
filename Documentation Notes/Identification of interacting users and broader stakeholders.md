<h1 align="center">Identification of Interacting Users and Broader Stakeholders</h1>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key aspect to consider during the proposal of this project idea was who the interacting users would be, and any broader stakeholders affected by the project idea. Initially the platform was to be simed at users of any demographic or city within the Uk. However after several group discussions this was decided to be too logistically challenging within the given timeframe and so the user group was narrwed down first to only House mate finding in wards of  Bristol wards, and then further narrowed down to use by only students of the University of Bristol. These decisions have allowed the group to keep the user group rlatively confined, easily identifiable and manageable.</p>
